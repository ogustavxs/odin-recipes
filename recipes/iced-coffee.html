        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons of instant coffee</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon of sugar</li>
            <li>200 ml of cold milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of very cold water</li>
            <li>Ice to taste</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract to taste (optional)</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients to prepare a delicious and super easy creamy iced coffee.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, add the coffee, sugar, cold water, and quickly beat with a whisk for about 5 minutes or until a shiny and thick cream forms - you can also use a mixer or hand blender to make it easier.</li>
            <li>In a glass or cup, add some ice cubes, the milk, and the vanilla extract. Stir to chill well.</li>
            <li>Then, add about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the creamy coffee and lightly stir to incorporate the ingredients.</li>
            <li>If desired, add more ice cubes and serve. The recipe yields up to three cups, so enjoy it with your loved ones. If you donâ€™t use it all, you can store it in a container with a lid in the refrigerator.</li>
